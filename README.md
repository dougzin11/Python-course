# Python-course
This is a Python refresher course taken from [Ignor√¢ncia Zero Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfCKf0-awunOu2WyLe2pSD2fXUo795xRe).

PS: A couple of lectures are missing because I did not think it was worth it writing Python codes for me to remind the concepts. However, if you are new to Python (and speak portuguese - the language which the course is taught), I highly recommend you going over trough the original lectures.
